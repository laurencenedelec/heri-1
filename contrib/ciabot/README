These are hook scripts for the CIA notification service at <http://cia.vc/>

They are maintained by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>.  There is an
upstream resource page for them at <http://www.catb.org/esr/ciabot/>,
but they are unlikely to change rapidly.

You probably want the Python version; it's faster, more capable, and
better documented.  The shell version is maintained only as a fallback
for use on hosting sites that don't permit Python hook scripts.

To test these scripts, your project needs to have been registered with
the CIA site.  Here are the steps:

1. Open an IRC window on irc://freenode/commits or your registered
   project IRC channel.

2. Run ciabot.py and/or ciabot.sh from any directory under git
   control, using the -p option to pass in your project name.

You should see a notification on the channel for your most recent commit.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
