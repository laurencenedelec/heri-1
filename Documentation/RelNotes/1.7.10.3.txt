Git v1.7.10.3 Release Notes
===========================

Fixes since v1.7.10.2
---------------------

 * The message file for German translation has been updated a bit.

 * "git status --porcelain" ignored "--branch" option by mistake.  The
   output for "git status --branch -z" was also incorrect and did not
   terminate the record for the current branch name with NUL as asked.

 * Running "git checkout" on an unborn branch used to corrupt HEAD.

 * When checking out another commit from an already detached state, we
   used to report all commits that are not reachable from any of the
   refs as lossage, but some of them might be reachable from the new
   HEAD, and there is no need to warn about them.

 * Some time ago, "git clone" lost the progress output for its
   "checkout" phase; when run without any "--quiet" option, it should
   give progress to the lengthy operation.

 * "log -z --pretty=tformat:..." did not terminate each record with
   NUL.  The fix is not entirely correct when the output also asks for
   --patch and/or --stat, though.

 * The DWIM behaviour for "log --pretty=format:%gd -g" was somewhat
   broken and gave undue precedence to configured log.date, causing
   "git stash list" to show "stash@{time stamp string}".

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
