Git v1.7.10.2 Release Notes
===========================

Fixes since v1.7.10.1
---------------------

 * The test scaffolding for git-daemon was flaky.

 * The test scaffolding for fast-import was flaky.

 * The filesystem boundary was not correctly reported when .git directory
   discovery stopped at a mount point.

 * HTTP transport that requires authentication did not work correctly when
   multiple connections are used simultaneously.

 * In the older days, the header "Conflicts:" in "cherry-pick" and "merge"
   was separated by a blank line from the list of paths that follow for
   readability, but when "merge" was rewritten in C, we lost it by
   mistake. Remove the newline from "cherry-pick" to make them match
   again.

 * The command line parser choked "git cherry-pick $name" when $name can
   be both revision name and a pathname, even though $name can never be a
   path in the context of the command.

 * "git config --rename-section" to rename an existing section into a
   bogus one did not check the new name.

 * The "diff --no-index" codepath used limited-length buffers, risking
   pathnames getting truncated.  Update it to use the strbuf API.

 * The report from "git fetch" said "new branch" even for a non branch
   ref.

 * Octopus merge strategy did not reduce heads that are recorded in the
   final commit correctly.

 * The i18n of error message "git stash save" was not properly done.

 * When using a Perl script on a system where "perl" found on user's
   $PATH could be ancient or otherwise broken, we allow builders to
   specify the path to a good copy of Perl with $PERL_PATH.  The
   gitweb test forgot to use that Perl when running its test.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
