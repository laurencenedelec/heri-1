Git v1.8.3 Release Notes
========================

Backward compatibility notes (for Git 2.0)
------------------------------------------

When "git push [$there]" does not say what to push, we have used the
traditional "matching" semantics so far (all your branches were sent
to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same name
over there).  In Git 2.0, the default will change to the "simple"
semantics that pushes the current branch to the branch with the same
name, only when the current branch is set to integrate with that
remote branch.  There is a user preference configuration variable
"push.default" to change this.  If you are an old-timer who is used
to the "matching" semantics, you can set it to "matching" to keep the
traditional behaviour.  If you want to live in the future early,
you can set it to "simple" today without waiting for Git 2.0.

When "git add -u" and "git add -A", that does not specify what paths
to add on the command line is run from inside a subdirectory, these
commands will operate on the entire tree in Git 2.0 for consistency
with "git commit -a" and other commands. Because there will be no
mechanism to make "git add -u" behave as if "git add -u .", it is
important for those who are used to "git add -u" (without pathspec)
updating the index only for paths in the current subdirectory to start
training their fingers to explicitly say "git add -u ." when they mean
it before Git 2.0 comes.

Fixes since v1.8.2
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.8.2 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * The "--color=<when>" argument to the commands in the diff family
   was described poorly.
   (merge 3d0e75f jc/color-diff-doc later to maint).

 * The arguments given to pre-rebase hook were not documented.
   (merge 0414acc wk/doc-pre-rebase later to maint).

 * The v4 index format was not documented.
   (merge 647d879 nd/doc-index-format later to maint).

 * The "--match=<pattern>" argument "git describe" takes uses glob
   pattern but it wasn't obvious from the documentation.
   (merge 5229149 gp/describe-match-uses-glob-pattern later to maint).

 * Some sources failed to compile on systems that lack NI_MAXHOST in
   their system header (e.g. z/OS).
   (merge 3b130ade dm/ni-maxhost-may-be-missing later to maint).

 * Add an example use of "--env-filter" in "filter-branch"
   documentation.
   (merge 21b6e4f tk/doc-filter-branch later to maint).

 * "git bundle verify" did not say "records a complete history" for a
   bundle that does not have any prerequisites.
   (merge a02ffe0 lf/bundle-verify-list-prereqs later to maint).

 * In the v1.8.0 era, we changed symbols that do not have to be global
   to file scope static, but a few functions in graph.c were used by
   CGit from sideways bypassing the entry points of the API the
   in-tree users use.
   (merge ac751a0 jk/graph-c-expose-symbols-for-cgit later to maint).
