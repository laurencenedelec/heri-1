Git v1.7.11 Release Notes
=========================

Updates since v1.7.10
---------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * A third-party tool "git subtree" is distributed in contrib/


Foreign Interface


Performance


Internal Implementation (please report possible regressions)

 * More lower-level commands learned to use the streaming API to read
   from the object store without keeping everything in core.


Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.10
-------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.10 in the maintenance
releases are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * "git commit --author=$name" did not tell the name that was being
   recorded in the resulting commit to hooks, even though it does do
   so when the end user overrode the authorship via the
   "GIT_AUTHOR_NAME" environment variable.
   (merge 7dfe8ad jc/commit-hook-authorship later to maint).

 * The regexp configured with diff.wordregex was incorrectly reused
   across files.
   (merge 6440d34 tr/maint-word-diff-regex-sticky later to maint).

 * Running "notes merge --commit" failed to perform correctly when run
   from any directory inside $GIT_DIR/.  When "notes merge" stops with
   conflicts, $GIT_DIR/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE is the place a user edits
   to resolve it.
   (merge dabba59 jh/notes-merge-in-git-dir-worktree later to maint).
