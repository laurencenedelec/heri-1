Git v1.8.2 Release Notes
========================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

In the upcoming major release (tentatively called 1.8.2), we will
change the behavior of the "git push" command.

When "git push [$there]" does not say what to push, we have used the
traditional "matching" semantics so far (all your branches were sent
to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same name
over there).  We will use the "simple" semantics that pushes the
current branch to the branch with the same name, only when the current
branch is set to integrate with that remote branch.  There is a user
preference configuration variable "push.default" to change this.

Fixes since v1.8.1
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.8.1 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * An element on GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES list that does not name the
   real path to a directory (i.e. a symbolic link) could have caused
   the GIT_DIR discovery logic to escape the ceiling.
   (merge 059b379 mh/ceiling later to maint).

 * t4014, t9502 and t0200 tests had various portability issues that
   broke on OpenBSD.
   (merge 27f6342 jc/maint-test-portability later to maint).

 * t9020 and t3600 tests had various portability issues.
   (merge 5a02966 jc/test-portability later to maint).

 * t9200 runs "cvs init" on a directory that already exists, but a
   platform can configure this fail for the current user (e.g. you
   need to be in the cvsadmin group on NetBSD 6.0).
   (merge 8666df0 jc/test-cvs-no-init-in-existing-dir later to maint).

 * After failing to create a temporary file using mkstemp(), failing
   pathname was not reported correctly on some platforms.
   (merge f7be59b jc/mkstemp-more-careful-error-reporting later to maint).

 * The way "git svn" asked for password using SSH_ASKPASS and
   GIT_ASKPASS was not in line with the rest of the system.
   (merge e9263e4 ss/svn-prompt later to maint).

 * The --graph code fell into infinite loop when asked to do what the
   code did not expect.
   (merge 656197a mk/maint-graph-infinity-loop later to maint).

 * http transport was wrong to ask for the username when the
   authentication is done by certificate identity.
   (merge 75e9a40 rb/http-cert-cred-no-username-prompt later to maint).

 * "git pack-refs" that ran in parallel to another process that
   created new refs had a nasty race.
   (merge b3f1280 jk/repack-ref-racefix later to maint).

 * After "git add -N" and then writing a tree object out of the
   index, the cache-tree data structure got corrupted.
   (merge eec3e7e nd/invalidate-i-t-a-cache-tree later to maint).

 * "gitweb", when sorting by age to show repositories with new
   activities first, used to sort repositories with absolutely
   nothing in it early, which was not very useful.
   (merge 28dae18 md/gitweb-sort-by-age later to maint).

 * When a line to be wrapped has a solid run of non space characters
   whose length exactly is the wrap width, "git shortlog -w" failed
   to add a newline after such a line.
   (merge e0db176 sp/shortlog-missing-lf later to maint).

 * Some shells do not behave correctly when IFS is unset; work it
   around by explicitly setting it to the default value.
   (merge 393050c jc/maint-fbsd-sh-ifs-workaround later to maint).
