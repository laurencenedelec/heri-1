Git v1.8.0 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.7.12
---------------------

UI, Workflows & Features


Foreign Interface

 * "git svn" has been updated to work with SVN 1.7.


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc. (please report possible regressions)

 * The "check-docs" build target has been updated and greatly
   simplified.


Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.12
-------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.12 in the
maintenance track are contained in this release (see release notes
to them for details).

 * "git send-email" did not unquote encoded words that appear on the
   header correctly, and lost "_" from strings.
   (merge b622d4d tr/maint-send-email-2047 later to maint).

 * When the user gives an argument that can be taken as both a
   revision name and a pathname without disambiguating with "--", we
   used to give a help message "Use '--' to separate".  The message
   has been clarified to show where that '--' goes on the command
   line.
   (merge 4d4b573 mm/die-with-dashdash-help later to maint).

 * "gitweb" when used with PATH_INFO failed to notice directories with
   SP (and other characters that need URL-style quoting) in them.
   (merge cacfc09 js/gitweb-path-info-unquote later to maint).
