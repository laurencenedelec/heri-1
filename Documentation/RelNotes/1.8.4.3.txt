Git v1.8.4.3 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v1.8.4.2
--------------------

 * "git rev-list --objects ^v1.0^ v1.0" gave v1.0 tag itself in the
   output, but "git rev-list --objects v1.0^..v1.0" did not.

 * The fall-back parsing of commit objects with broken author or
   committer lines were less robust than ideal in picking up the
   timestamps.

 * Bash prompting code to deal with an SVN remote as an upstream
   were coded in a way not supported by older Bash versions (3.x).

 * "git checkout topic", when there is not yet a local "topic" branch
   but there is a unique remote-tracking branch for a remote "topic"
   branch, pretended as if "git checkout -t -b topic remote/$r/topic"
   (for that unique remote $r) was run. This hack however was not
   implemented for "git checkout topic --".

 * Coloring around octopus merges in "log --graph" output was screwy.

 * We did not generate HTML version of documentation to "git subtree"
   in contrib/.

 * The synopsis section of "git unpack-objects" documentation has been
   clarified a bit.

 * An ancient How-To on serving Git repositories on an HTTP server
   lacked a warning that it has been mostly superseded with more
   modern way.

Also contains a handful of trivial code clean-ups, documentation
updates, updates to the test suite, etc.
