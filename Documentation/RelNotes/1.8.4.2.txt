Git v1.8.4.2 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v1.8.4.1
--------------------

 * When running "fetch -q", a long silence while the sender side
   computes the set of objects to send can be mistaken by proxies as
   dropped connection.  The server side has been taught to send a
   small empty messages to keep the connection alive.

 * When the webserver responds with "405 Method Not Allowed", "git
   http-backend" should tell the client what methods are allowed with
   the "Allow" header.

 * "git cvsserver" computed the permission mode bits incorrectly for
   executable files.

 * The implementation of "add -i" has a crippling code to work around
   ActiveState Perl limitation but it by mistake also triggered on Git
   for Windows where MSYS perl is used.

 * We made sure that we notice the user-supplied GIT_DIR is actually a
   gitfile, but did not do the same when the default ".git" is a
   gitfile.

 * When an object is not found after checking the packfiles and then
   loose object directory, read_sha1_file() re-checks the packfiles to
   prevent racing with a concurrent repacker; teach the same logic to
   has_sha1_file().

 * "git commit --author=$name", when $name is not in the canonical
   "A. U. Thor <au.thor@example.xz>" format, looks for a matching name
   from existing history, but did not consult mailmap to grab the
   preferred author name.

 * The commit object names in the insn sheet that was prepared at the
   beginning of "rebase -i" session can become ambiguous as the
   rebasing progresses and the repository gains more commits. Make
   sure the internal record is kept with full 40-hex object names.

 * "git rebase --preserve-merges" internally used the merge machinery
   and as a side effect, left merge summary message in the log, but
   when rebasing, there should not be a need for merge summary.

 * "git rebase -i" forgot that the comment character can be
   configurable while reading its insn sheet.

Also contains a handful of trivial code clean-ups, documentation
updates, updates to the test suite, etc.
