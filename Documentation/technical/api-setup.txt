Pathspec
--------

See glossary-context.txt for the syntax of pathspec. In memory, a
pathspec set is represented by "struct pathspec" and is prepared by
parse_pathspec(). This function takes several arguments:

- magic_mask specifies what features that are NOT supported by the
  following code. If a user attempts to use such a feature,
  parse_pathspec() can reject it early.

- flags specifies other things that the caller wants parse_pathspec to
  perform.

- prefix and args come from cmd_* functions

get_pathspec() is obsolete and should never be used in new code.
